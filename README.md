# Python Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains weekly assignments completed for my Python Programming course DSC 430 during Spring 2025. Each script demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, control flow, loops, user input handling, and basic object-oriented design.

## ðŸ“š Assignments

Each assignment includes a link to a Loom video where I walk through the code and explain how it works.

### Week 1: Python Review
- **Grading Logic (`week1-101.py`)**  
  Simulates how homework is graded using conditional checks and deduction rules for late submissions.

- **Coprime Test (`week1-102.py`)**  
  Asks users for two numbers and determines if they are coprime by comparing their prime factors.

### Week 2: Algorithm Design
- **Stem-and-Leaf Plot Generator (`A0201.py`)**  
  Reads numeric datasets and displays them in a stem-and-leaf format, grouped by tens and units.

### Week 3: Best Practices
- **Goldbach's Conjecture Check (`A0301.py`)**  
  For every even number between 4 and 100, finds one pair of prime numbers that sum to it â€” exploring Goldbach's Conjecture.

- **Happy Number Check (`A0302.py`)**
  Check whether the given number is happy or sad and return the list of all numbers visited in the verification process.

### Week 4: Algorithm Development and Analysis
- **Goldbach Deuce (`A0401.py`)**  
  Determine if any two numbers in a randomly generated list sum to a target value using an efficient O(n log n) binary search approach.

- **Human Pyramid (`A0402.py`)**
  Recursively compute the weight supported by a person in a human pyramid, where each individual splits weight evenly between those below.
  
### Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming

### Week 6: Managing Data

### Week 7: Monte Carlo

### Week 8: Numeric Python Packages

### Week 9: Matplotlib Visualization

### Week 10: Software Engineering Tips


## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- Working with user input
- Logical and mathematical thinking
- Reading and writing to files
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Prime number and factor logic
- Object-oriented programming
- Errors and exceptions

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- These are practice scripts from my second Python class, documenting the early stages of my Python learning journey. I plan to create more advanced projects as I continue to grow.
