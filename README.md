# Python Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains weekly assignments completed for my Python Programming course DSC 430 during Spring 2025. Each script demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, control flow, loops, user input handling, and basic object-oriented design.

## ðŸ“š Assignments

Each assignment includes a link to a Loom video where I walk through the code and explain how it works.

### Week 1
- **Grading Logic (`week1-101.py`)**  
  Simulates how homework is graded using conditional checks and deduction rules for late submissions.

- **Coprime Test (`week1-102.py`)**  
  Asks users for two numbers and determines if they are coprime by comparing their prime factors.

### Week 2
- **Stem-and-Leaf Plot Generator (`A0201.py`)**  
  Reads numeric datasets and displays them in a stem-and-leaf format, grouped by tens and units.

### Week 3
- **Goldbach's Conjecture Check (`A0301-Thuy Nguyen.py`)**  
  For every even number between 4 and 100, finds one pair of prime numbers that sum to it â€” exploring Goldbach's Conjecture.

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- Working with user input
- Logical and mathematical thinking
- Reading and writing to files
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Prime number and factor logic
- Object-oriented programming

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
These are beginner-level practice scripts and part of my journey to learn Python. I plan to build more advanced projects over time.
